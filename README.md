## Summary

**Dog Carousel** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of shibes from the shibe.online API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üëÄüîéüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

In the future, I would like to add buttons to refresh the images on the app, add clickable links and implement a dark mode button.
