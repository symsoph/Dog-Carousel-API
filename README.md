# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Sofia**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Summary

**RandArt** is an android app that **that displays basic information and a photo of random objects at the MET museum**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üî•üï∏Ô∏èüôÉ**

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

I had a hard time finding an API that was easy enough to use and understand how to use.  So that part took a while, but the lab was helpful for this project. I wish we went over
how to manipulate JSON. Still had some fun though.
