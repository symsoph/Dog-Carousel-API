# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Sofia**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Dog Carousel** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of shibes from the shibe.online API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üå©Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏èüêï‚Äçü¶∫**

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [X] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [X] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

I am glad that I figured out how to use this REST API and in the future, I would like to implement more features like buttons to present scrollable bird and cat(?) images from that same API.  It was very fun to work with the carousel once I got everything working.
